# Booking System

## Overview

Booking system is a small project done by me to improve my understanding of JavaScript and learn about CRUD operations. This project allows users to book rooms, manage bookings, and view room details locally with the help of localStorage.

## Features

- **Room Booking**: Users can book rooms by providing necessary details.
- **Manage Bookings**: Admin can view, edit, and delete bookings.details.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/booking-system.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd booking-system
   ```
3. **Open the project in your preferred code editor**.

## Usage

1. **Open `index.html` in your web browser** to view the main page.
2. **Use the admin interface** (`components/admin.html`) to manage room bookings and details.
